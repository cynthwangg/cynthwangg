## Hi everyoneüëã I'm Cynthia!

I'm an undergrad at Stanford University studying Computer Science (AI track) and Economics. 

### üõ†Ô∏è Previous Experience
- Building Primer, a seamless checkout experience for every consumer. [Collaborated with Coinbase](https://x.com/0xyoussea/status/1958287663519105167) + live demo linked [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q18pnAODgqQ&t=7647s). 100K+ total impressions on the project. 
- I won 2nd place (Web3 track) at TreeHacks, the largest collegiate hackathon, with MediLedger. Check out the [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/mediledger). 
- I also won bounties from startups like Nillion, Ablo, and EigenLayer for Creator.IP, an AI image generation agent. ~$30K in hackathon wins this year, extensive experience with TypeScript, Python, Node.js, Express.js, and AI tooling.

### üöÄ Current side quests
- Building [DeadDrop](https://github.com/hackingdecentralized/deaddrop), a smart contract bug reporting protocol using Oblivious Message Retrieval (OMR). We let security researchers responsibly alert developers! This is a project for the [Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3)](https://www.initc3.org/) in NYC. 
- Software engineering intern for Magic Eden - first intern hire on a team of 140+.
