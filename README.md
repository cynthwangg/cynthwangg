## Hi everyoneüëã I'm Cynthia!

I'm an undergraduate at Stanford University studying Computer Science (AI track) and Economics. I'm passionate about using my technical skills for social good, especially through startups. Right now, I'm obsessed with fintech, consumer applications, and scalable blockchain infra.

### üõ†Ô∏è Previous Experience
- I won second place (Web3 track) at TreeHacks, the largest collegiate hackathon, with MediLedger. Check out the [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/mediledger). 
- I also won bounties at ETHDenver from Nillion, Ablo, and EigenLayer for Creator.IP, an AI image generation agent. Total hackathon winnings this year is ~$20K.
- Researched AI verticals for three public mega-cap investment firms on a contract basis. Also taught competition math (AMC 10/12 & AIME) at Art of Problem Solving.

### üöÄ Current side quests
- Building Dead Drop, a smart contract bug reporting protocol using Oblivious Message Retrieval (OMR). We let security researchers responsibly alert developers! This is a project for the [Initiative for CryptoCurrencies and Contracts (IC3)](https://www.initc3.org/) in NYC.
- Curating Elsewhere, the world's first late-night cafe coworking network. We're launching our first San Francisco pop-up in July!
- Incoming software engineering intern for Magic Eden, the "everything platform" for crypto. Hard-launching features on the Bitcoin team.
- Leading [Stanford Blockchain](https://blockchain.stanford.edu/) as VP of Events! If you're cool, feel free to reach out.
